# Sum-of-all-numbers-in-interval-with-GUI
A simple program to calculate the sum of numbers in a given interval. Additionally I added a GUI for better parameter input.


To use it simply open the blueJ package in BlueJ or 
put the Window.java class into a IDE of your choice and then create a object of it manually.
